# DORA metrics and Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit

On this short tutorial we explore the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit to monitor, observe and react to our cloud native applications lifecycle events. 


## Installation

You need a Kubernetes Cluster to install [Keptn KLT](https://keptn.sh). You can create one using Kubernetes KinD as we did in [Chapter 2](https://github.com/salaboy/platforms-on-k8s/blob/main/chapter-2/README.md#creating-a-local-cluster-with-kubernetes-kind)
